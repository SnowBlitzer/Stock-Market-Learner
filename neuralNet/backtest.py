# STRATEGY - A Strategy class receives a Pandas DataFrame of bars, i.e. a list of Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV) 
# data points at a particular frequency. The Strategy will produce a list of signals, which consist of a timestamp 
# and an element from the set {1,0,âˆ’1} indicating a long (buy), hold, or short (sell) signal respectively.
# PORTFOLIO - The majority of the backtesting work will occur in the Portfolio class. It will receive a set of signals
# (as described above) and create a series of positions, allocated against a cash component. The job of the Portfolio
# object is to produce an equity curve, incorporate basic transaction costs and keep track of trades.
# PERFORMANCE - The Performance object takes a portfolio and produces a set of statistics about its performance. In 
# particular it will output risk/return characteristics (Sharpe, Sortino and Information Ratios), trade/profit 
# metrics and drawdown information.
